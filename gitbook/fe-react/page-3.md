## Creating React Project

{% hint style="info" %}
We will use a basic project with no extending framework.
{% endhint %}

Firstly, create a new project in the required folder:

```
npm create-react-app fav-urls
```

Now, you can look into the `fav-urls` directory and take look at its structure.

TODO more structure info

Then, we will directly add some libraries needed in our project realization:

* **react-form-hook** for easy form validation and submitting;
* **material-design-for-boostrap MDB** for predefined components and bootstrap support via components;
* **axios** for HTTP requests;
* **toastify** for easy toast support;
* **react-router-dom** for routing support;
* **reactjs-popup** for popup dialogs and forms;

Run the console **in(!)** the folder of the project and execute the following:

```
npm install react-form-hook
npm install mdb-react-ui-kit
npm install axios
npm install react-toastify
npm install react-router-dom
npm install reactjs-popup
```
