# Database & JPA

## Expected database schema

{% hint style="info" %}
Database schema is not expected here to be fixed and is a subject of later changes. At the beginning of the project, you cannot define the whole database correctly, as the requirements by the costumer, or restrictions by the technologies may apply. So, at the beginning, only the skeleton of the database project is expected to be created.\
\
However, in our case we will create the whole database at once, so we do not need return to this chapter later in this course.
{% endhint %}



## Database connection and initilaization

TODO how to connect & reate database
